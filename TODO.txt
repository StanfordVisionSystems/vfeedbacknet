Things to debug/try

This weekend!
- restore full RGB inputs
- try to train VGG16 (only fc layers) to 70% top-1
- try to train VGG16 full to 70% top-1
- try training the basic feedback net to a reasonable accruacy on imagenet (hopefully 65-70%)
- transfer weights to ucf-101 and hmdb-51 (see how it does, is it even close to competitive?)

Future...
- try other variants of the network architecture that have more interesting temporal properties
    * early prediction
    * taxonomic classification
    * taking advantage of temporal information for faster analysis

- figure out what other tasks besides action recognition could benefit from this approach
    *
